# Statistical discrimination

This repository contains the code accompanying the publication **Perceptual
interventions ameliorate statistical discrimination in learning agents**,
published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2024.

## Usage

### Figures and Supporting Information data

You can load the dataset and the code used to produce the figures in the
research article using Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/statistical_discrimination/blob/main/notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb)

The full data used in the paper is at
https://storage.googleapis.com/statistical_discrimination/data.zip

### Environment configuration

The environment used is from
[Melting Pot](https://github.com/google-deepmind/meltingpot)
The specific configuration with custom avatars and perceptual interventions
is available in the Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/statistical_discrimination/blob/main/notebooks/environment.ipynb).
Examples for configurations using perceptual interventions and without them are
given.
